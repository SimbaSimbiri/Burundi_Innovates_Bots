# Burundi_Innovates_Bots
The repository contains a collection of chatbots built for Code Your Dreams students in Burundi

Code Your Dreams is a non-profit as well as an EdTech organization that aims to teach underprivileged students Computer Science. The projects in this repository are now a part of the next cohort's Text-Based Application Curriculum. All are chatbots integrated into WhatsApp and some use different APIs to extend the chatbot's functionality. 

A notable chatbot is the gptWhatsapp Chatbot that incorporated Open AI's ChatCompletion API to allow ChatGPT responses in WhatsApp. This chatbot is to be used both for instructional purposes and also in remote contexts, to help  students in Burundi access summarized information over the internet without really accessing the internet which is a hindrance because of low network speeds. 

Other chatbots are more of instructor examples where students can emulate them to design their own bots under the guidance of CS mentors/teachers.
